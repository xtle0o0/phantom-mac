An advanced MAC address ghosting tool that works across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Features ‚ú®

- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Beautiful terminal UI with animations
- Random MAC address generation from common vendors
- MAC address validation
- Backup and restore original MAC addresses
- Administrative privilege checking
- Colored output and status indicators

## Prerequisites üìã

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Administrative privileges (sudo/admin)
- Network interface with MAC changing capability
- Git (for installation)

## Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xtle0o0/phantom-mac.git
    cd phantom-mac
    ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

    # Windows
    python -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage üíª

### Show current MAC address:
- **Linux/macOS**
    ```bash
    sudo python phantom_mac.py -i wlan0 -s
    ```
- **Windows (Run as Administrator)**
    ```bash
    python phantom_mac.py -i "Wi-Fi" -s
    ```

### Change to random MAC address:
- **Linux/macOS**
    ```bash
    sudo python phantom_mac.py -i wlan0
    ```
- **Windows (Run as Administrator)**
    ```bash
    python phantom_mac.py -i "Wi-Fi"
    ```

### Change to specific MAC address:
- **Linux/macOS**
    ```bash
    sudo python phantom_mac.py -i wlan0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
    ```
- **Windows (Run as Administrator)**
    ```bash
    python phantom_mac.py -i "Wi-Fi" -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
    ```

### Restore original MAC address:
- **Linux/macOS**
    ```bash
    sudo python phantom_mac.py -i wlan0 -r
    ```
- **Windows (Run as Administrator)**
    ```bash
    python phantom_mac.py -i "Wi-Fi" -r
    ```

## Common Interface Names üîå

- **Linux**: `wlan0`, `eth0`, `wlp3s0`
- **macOS**: `en0`, `en1`
- **Windows**: `"Wi-Fi"`, `"Ethernet"` (use quotes if the name contains spaces)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

1. **Administrative Privileges**:
   - Always run with sudo (Linux/macOS) or as Administrator (Windows)
   - Incorrect usage may require system restart to recover network functionality

2. **Network Interruption**:
   - MAC address changes will temporarily disconnect your network
   - Ensure you have an alternative way to restore connectivity if needed
   - Some operations may require system restart

3. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Not all network interfaces support MAC address changes
   - Some devices may revert changes after restart
   - Virtual interfaces may have additional restrictions

4. **Legal Considerations**:
   - MAC address spoofing may be restricted in some networks/organizations
   - Check your local network policies before use
   - Use responsibly and ethically

5. **Backup**:
   - Original MAC addresses are backed up automatically
   - Keep note of your original MAC address before making changes
   - Some changes may persist after system restart

## Troubleshooting üîß

1. If the network doesn't reconnect:
   - Wait 30 seconds for the interface to stabilize
   - Try disabling and re-enabling the network interface
   - Restart your system as a last resort

2. If changes don't apply:
   - Verify administrative privileges
   - Check the interface name is correct
   - Ensure the interface supports MAC changes
   - Try disabling the network manager temporarily

3. If restore fails:
   - Use a hardware reset (restart)
   - Check the backup file in `src/mac_backup.json`
   - Use the device manager to reset the network adapter
